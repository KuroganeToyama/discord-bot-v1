# Toyama Discord Bot
I made this small little Discord bot as a fun personal project. 
<br><br>
I got to learn a lot of basic back-end development, but more importantly, I had fun! :smile:
<br><br>
And in case you're wondering why the repo name is `discord-bot-v1`, well that was a name I randomly came up with.
I hadn't decided the name for my bot back then.

# Note
Yeah, I know I got naughty with `waifu` command. Please don't call me out for that. :sob:
